# YieldVault Pro

## Project Description

YieldVault Pro is an automated yield optimization protocol built on the Stacks blockchain that maximizes returns by continuously rebalancing funds across multiple DeFi protocols. The protocol automatically allocates user deposits to the highest-yielding opportunities while maintaining diversification and risk management.

Key features:
- **Automated Yield Optimization**: Continuously monitors and rebalances across multiple DeFi protocols (ALEX, Arkadiko, StackSwap)
- **Tokenized Shares**: Users receive vault shares (fungible tokens) representing their proportional ownership
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Smart allocation algorithm that places 70% of funds in the highest-yielding protocol and 15% each in the remaining protocols
- **Real-time APY Tracking**: Monitors current APY rates across supported protocols
- **Minimum Deposit Protection**: Ensures meaningful participation with 100 STX minimum deposit
- **Transparent Operations**: All rebalancing and optimization events are logged on-chain

## Project Vision

To democratize access to sophisticated yield farming strategies by creating an automated, transparent, and efficient protocol that maximizes returns for all users regardless of their DeFi expertise or capital size. YieldVault Pro aims to become the premier yield optimization solution on the Stacks ecosystem, providing institutional-grade portfolio management to retail users.

Our vision includes:
- **Accessibility**: Making advanced DeFi strategies available to everyone
- **Automation**: Removing the complexity of manual yield farming
- **Transparency**: All operations and decisions are verifiable on-chain
- **Security**: Prioritizing fund safety through diversification and risk management
- **Innovation**: Continuously integrating new protocols and optimization strategies
